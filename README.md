<p id="description">This project examines shopping trends through data analysis and clustering techniques.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Data Loading and Preprocessing: Reads the 'shopping\_trends\_updated.csv' file and performs data preprocessing steps.
*   Data Analysis: The dataset is explored checking for missing data and duplicates. Data distributions and relationships are visualized.
*   Clustering: K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering algorithms are applied to cluster the data.
*   Visualization of Results: Clustering results are visualized using 3D plots. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method.
